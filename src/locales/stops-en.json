        "The Algonquin People have lived in the Ottawa Valley for over 8,000 years, relying on its waterways for sustenance and trade. Their egalitarian, clan-based society was deeply connected to the land, but European arrival brought war, disease, and displacement.",
        "Despite the 1763 Royal Proclamation recognizing Indigenous land rights, colonial expansion and the lumber trade eroded Algonquin territories. Unlike many First Nations, they never signed a treaty ceding their land, and their claim remains unresolved.",
        "Today, over 40,000 Canadians identify as Algonquin, and efforts toward reconciliation and self-governance continue amid ongoing disputes and historical injustices."

        "During the War of 1812, Chief Pinesi and Algonquin warriors fought alongside the British, but their contributions were downplayed, and their land petitions ignored. Meanwhile, Bytown (now Ottawa) was founded in 1826 as a hub for canal construction, but it was the booming timber trade—kickstarted by Philemon Wright in 1806—that truly shaped the region. By the early 1900s, Ottawa's sawmills were among the world's most productive.",
        "Ottawa became Canada's capital in 1867, but the lumber industry remained its dominant economic force for decades. Over time, logging shifted toward pulp and paper before fading almost entirely. The environmental toll was immense, and the region's transformation marked the irreversible loss of the Indigenous way of life, despite their land never being ceded to European settlers."
